    <h2>My First Journey to the CYF London Office</h2>
    <section id="section-1">
      <p>Today was my first day visiting the CodeYourFuture office in London. I was excited to be there, meet my <q>code buddies</q> in person.</p>

      <h3>Setting Off</h3>
      <p>Planning my journey was not difficult. Just needed to take the tube from my place and walk some five minutes to arrive at the address. Naturally I used my satnav app for this. Piece of cake, or so I thought.</p>
      <p>I started my journey so I could arrive my destination on time. I had to change trains but luckily I did not need to waste time while waiting as my second train arrived right after I got off my first one!</p>

      <h3>I Got Lost</h3>
      <p>After getting off the tube at Brixton Station I followed my walking route to the centre. Now, here is where it got tricky. I followed the directions my phone's satnav showed me strictly and, interestingly enough, it led me to an alleyway!</p>
      <p>There was only a brickwall on the left side. A lot of noise was coming through the wall and I wondered, <q>Could that be CYF?</q> <q>Is the centre this much active?</q> On the right side a couple of people were unloading a van that blocked the path to my <q>pin on the map</q>, and taking their loads through what appeared to be a side entrance into...I don't know...a grocery store?</p>

      <p>I did not want to accept the fact that I was fooled and hoped I might find the entrance to <q>my CYF</q> somewhere on the left side of the alleyway. I resigned when I realised I would hit a dead end, of sorts. The crew working at the van also understood I had lost my way and indicated I could not find any entrance there to whatever they thought I wanted to go to. Of course I made it clear it was not my fault? It was the satnav's, wasn't it?</p>
      <p>At this time I was already on the last minutes before my intended 10 am arrival time, so I came out of that alleyway and turned right to  start my round-the-corner walk in order to find the real entrance to the center. As soon as I came out of the alleyway I found out it was the gym where all that noise came from. That made sense!</p>
      <p><q>This time I could not let myself tricked again!</q>, I thought, then continued my journey and made sure I came out onto Stockwell Road. Funny I did not think about that in the first place!</p>

      <h3>Blue Star House</h3>
      <p>Now I am on the correct side and direction of Stockwell Road, finding door number was my next endeavour.</p>

      <p><q>Hi, Nandos! Do you host CYF somewhere in your property by any chance?</q></p>
      <p><q>What's that tall building behind you, by the way?</q></p>
      <p><q>Well, that must be where CYF center is, but how to get in there, umm...</q></p>
      <p><q>The other place I just passed, where it says 'Blue Star House', cannot be it, can it? It seems to be part of that same building Nandos is though. Alright....</q></p>
      <p><q>Well, given the property next to Nandos has 246 written on it, I reckon Blue Star House is my best bet. On to Blue Star House, then!</q></p>
